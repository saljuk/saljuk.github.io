        <h2 class="form-landing">When you were thinking of university or applying to colleges, the biggest questions
            you asked yourself might've been 'Where do I stand
            compared to others?' or 'Do I have a shot for X college with my grades?'. It's a
            confusing time and a crazy world where counselling agencies stand ready to grab your money.
            We want to help change that.
        </h2>
        <h3 class="form-landing">
            <em>Kya Scope Hai?</em> allows students thinking of
            college to look at the anonymous data of numerous past applicants like yourself.
            Our data analytics tool will then utilise this data and enable students to pick the
            colleges that suit them the best - all without the pressures and costs that
            accompany this already-stressful time.
